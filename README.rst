======================
Parmus' Gentoo Overlay
======================

This is my private `Gentoo Overlay`_ containing adhoc ebuild, which I use to install software on my own systems.
You're most welcome to try them out for yourself, but your milage might vary.

Disclaimer
----------

* All ebuilds here are provided AS-IS. Use them at your own risk.
* Since I only have AMD64 architectures myself, I will only maintain ebuilds for amd64. Some ebuild might work for
  x86 with little or no extra work, but I'm not testing this platform.
* I try to keep the license files up-to-date, but since some of the ebuilds are installing proprietary, their official
  license might have changed. The software's own official license ALSO have precedence over the license in the ebuild,
  and it's your own resposibility to check the official license.

Contributing
------------

* If you find that some of my ebuilds are broken or out-dated, you are most welcome to fix them and send me a patch.
* If you want to contribute an ebuild for a new package, then I will be happy to look at it. However it would be even
  better if you tried to get it accepted in the official Gentoo tree, so everyone can benefit from your hard work (^_^)
